== Release Notes for MicroProfile Config 2.0

A full list of changes delivered in the 2.0 release can be found at link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/milestone/8?closed=1[MicroProfile Config 2.0 Milestone].

=== Incompatible Changes

- ConfigSource#getPropertyNames is no longer a default method. The implementation of a ConfigSource must implement this method. (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/431[431])
- Previous versions of the specification would not evaluate Property Expressions. As such, previous working
configuration may behave differently (if the used configuration contains values with Property Expressions
syntax). Check the <<property-expressions,Property Expressions>> section on how to go back to the
previous behaviour.
- Empty value or other special characters are no longer a valid config value for a particular return type. Refer to the earlier section of this spec for more details.
In the previous release, the empty value was returned as an empty value. From now on, the empty value will cause `NoSuchElementException` to be thrown.

=== API/SPI Changes
- Convenience methods have been added to Config allowing for the retrieval of multi-valued properties as lists instead of arrays (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/496[#496])
- Enable bulk-extraction of config properties into a separate POJO by introducing `@ConfigProperties` (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/240[240])
- Enable users to determine the winning source for a configuration value (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/312[312]) (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/43[43])
- Expose conversion mechanism in Config API (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/492[492])
- Add unwrap() methods to Config (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/84[84])

=== Functional Changes
- Support Configuration Profiles so that the corresponding properties associated with the active profile are used (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/418[#418])
- Provide built-in Converters: OptinalInt, OptionalLong and OptionalDouble (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/513[513])
- Clarifies that Converters for primitive wrappers apply to primitive types as well (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/520[520])
- Clarify that nulls cannot be passed in to Converters (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/pull/542[542])
- Support Property Expressions: This provides a way to set and expand variables in property values (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/118[118])
- Specify the behaviour when a converter returns null (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/608[608])

=== Other Changes

[[release_notes_13]]
== Release Notes for MicroProfile Config 1.3

The following changes occurred in the 1.3 release, compared to 1.2

A full list of changes may be found on the link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/milestone/4?closed=1[MicroProfile Config 1.3 Milestone]

=== API/SPI Changes

No API/SPI changes.

=== Functional Changes

- The implicit (common sense) converters have been improved and some of the built-in converters are removed from the spec as they are covered by implicit converters. The method invocation sequence on implicit converters are further improved (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/325[#325]).

- Implementations must also support the mapping of a config property to the corresponding environment variable (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/264[#264])

=== Specification Changes

- Specification changes to document
 (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/348[#348]),
 (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/325[#325]),
 (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/264[#264])

=== Other Changes
More CTS were added:

- Assert URI will be converted (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/322[#322])

- Testing injecting an Optional<String> that has no config value (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/336[#336]).

- Built-in converters are automatically added to the injected config ((link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/348[#348])

Java2 security related change (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/343[#343])

[[release_notes_12]]
== Release Notes for MicroProfile Config 1.2

The following changes occurred in the 1.2 release, compared to 1.1

A full list of changes may be found on the link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/milestone/3?closed=1[MicroProfile Config 1.2 Milestone]

=== API/SPI Changes

- The `ConfigBuilder` SPI has been extended with a method that allows for a converter with the specified class type to be registered  (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/205[#205]). This change removes the limitation, which was unable to add a lambda converter, from the previous releases.

=== Functional Changes

- Implementations must now support the array converter (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/259[#259]).
For the array converter, the programmatic lookup of a property (e.g. `config.getValue(myProp, String[].class)`) must support the return type of the array. For the injection lookup, an Array, List or Set must be supported as well (e.g. `@Inject @ConfigProperty(name="myProp") private List<String> propValue;`).

- Implementations must also support the common sense converters (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/269[#269]) where there is no corresponding type of converters provided for a given class. The implementation must use the class's constructor with a single string parameter, then try `valueOf(String)` followed by `parse(CharSequence)`.

- Implementations must also support Class converter (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/267[#267])

=== Specification Changes

- Specification changes to document
 (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/205[#205]),
 (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/259[#259]),
 (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/269[#269])
 (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/267[#267])

=== Other Changes
The API bundle can work with either CDI 1.2 or CDI 2.0 in OSGi environment (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/249[#249]).

A TCK test was added to ensure the search path of `microprofile-config.properties` for a `war` archive is `WEB-INF\classes\META-INF` (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/268[#268])


[[release_notes_11]]
== Release Notes for MicroProfile Config 1.1

The following changes occurred in the 1.1 release, compared to 1.0

A full list of changes may be found on the link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/milestone/2?closed=1[MicroProfile Config 1.1 Milestone]

=== API/SPI Changes

- The `ConfigSource` SPI has been extended with a default method that returns the property names for a given `ConfigSource`  (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/178[#178])

=== Functional Changes

- Implementations must now include a `URL` Converter, of `@Priority(1)` (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/181[#181])
- The format of the default property name for an injection point using `@ConfigProperty` has been changed to no longer lower case the first letter of the class.  Implementations may still support this behavior.  Instead, MicroProfile Config 1.1 requires the actual class name to be used. (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/233[#233])
- Implementations must now support primitive types, in addition to the already specified primitive type wrappers (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/204[#204])

=== Specification Changes

- Clarified what it means for a value to be present (link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/issues/216[#216])
