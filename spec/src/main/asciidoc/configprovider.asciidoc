== Accessing or Creating a certain Configuration


For using Microprofile-Config in a programmatic way the `ConfigProvider` class is the central point to access a configuration.
It allows access to different configurations (represented by a `Config` instance) based on the application in which it is used.
The `ConfigProvider` internally delegates through to the `ConfigProviderResolver` which contains more low-level functionality.

There are 4 different ways to create a `Config` instance:

* In CDI managed components, a user can use `@Inject` to access the current application configuration.
  The default and the auto discovered <<configsource,ConfigSources>> will be gathered to form a configuration.
  The default and the auto discovered <<converters,Converters>> will be gathered to form a configuration.
  Injected instance of `Config` should behave the same as the one retrieved by `ConfigProvider.getConfig()`. 
  Injected config property values should be the same as if retrieved from an injected `Config` instance via `Config.getValue()`.

* A factory method `ConfigProvider#getConfig()` to create a `Config` object based on automatically picked up `ConfigSources`
  of the Application identified by the current Thread Context ClassLoader classpath.
  The default and the auto discovered <<converters,Converters>> will be gathered to form a configuration.
  Subsequent calls to this method for a certain Application will return the same `Config` instance.

* A factory method `ConfigProvider#getConfig(ClassLoader forClassLoader)` to create a `Config`   object based on automatically picked up `ConfigSources`
  of the Application identified by the given ClassLoader.
  The default and the auto discovered <<converters,Converters>> will be gathered to form a configuration.
  This can be used if the Thread Context ClassLoader does not represent the correct layer.
  E.g. if you need the Config for a class in a shared EAR lib folder.
  Subsequent calls to this method for a certain Application will return the same `Config` instance.

* A factory method `ConfigProviderResolver#getBuilder()` to create a `ConfigBuilder` object.
The builder has no config sources. Only the default converters are added. The `ConfigBuilder` object can be filled manually via methods like `ConfigBuilder#withSources(ConfigSources... sources)`.
   This configuration instance will by default not be shared by the `ConfigProvider`.
  This method is intended be used if a IoC container or any other external Factory can be used to give access to a manually created shared `Config`.

The `Config` object created via builder pattern can be managed as follows:

* A factory method `ConfigProviderResolver#registerConfig(Config config, ClassLoader classloader)` can be used to register a `Config` within the application.
  This configuration instance *will* be shared by `ConfigProvider#getConfig()`.
  Any subsequent call to `ConfigProvider#getConfig()` will return the registered `Config` instance for this application.
  
* A factory method `ConfigProviderResolver#releaseConfig(Config config)` to release the `Config` instance. This will unbind the current `Config` from the application.
The <<configsource, ConfigSources>> that implement the `java.io.Closeable` interface will be properly destroyed.
The <<converter, Converters>> that implement the `java.io.Closeable` interface will be properly destroyed.
Any subsequent call to `ConfigProvider#getConfig()` or `ConfigProvider#getConfig(ClassLoader forClassLoader)` will result in a new `Config` instance.

All methods in the `ConfigProvider`, `ConfigProviderResolver` and `Config` implementations are thread safe and reentrant.

The `Config` instances created via CDI are `Serializable`.

If a `Config` instance is created via `@Inject Config` or `ConfigProvider#getConfig()` or via the builder pattern but later called `ConfigProviderResolver#registerConfig(Config config, Classloader classloader)`, the `Config` instance will be released when the application is closed.
