== Property Expressions

The value of a configuration property may contain an expression corresponding to another configuration property. An
expression string is a mix of plain strings and expression segments, which are wrapped by the sequence `${ ... }`.

Consider the following configuration properties file:

[source,properties]
----
server.url=http://${server.host}/endpoint
server.host=example.org
----

When looking up the `server.url` property, the value will be resolved and expanded to `http://example.org/endpoint`.
All MicroProfile Config rules still apply. The `Config` is able to resolve expressions from different ConfigSources.

Additionally, it is also possible to use the following syntax for property expressions:

* `${expression:value}` - Provides a default value after the `:` if the expression doesn't find a value.
* `${my.prop${compose}}` - Composed expressions. Inner expressions are resolved first.
* `${my.prop}${my.prop}` - Multiple expressions.

Consider the following configuration properties file:

[source,properties]
----
server.url=http://${server.host:example.org}:${server.port}/${server.endpoint}
server.port=8080
server.endpoint=${server.endpoint.path.${server.endpoint.path.bar}}
server.endpoint.path.foo=foo
server.endpoint.path.bar=foo
----

The property `server.url` is expanded to `http://example.org:8080/foo`.

If an expression cannot be expanded and does not have a default value, a `NoSuchElementException` is thrown. In the
Optional case, an empty Optional will be returned.

The number of recursion lookups is not infinite, but a limited number for composed expressions. Implementations are
encouraged to limit the number to `5`, but they can use higher limits if they wish to. When the number of allowed
lookups exceeds the limit, a `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

Property expressions applies to all the methods in `Config` that performs resolution of a configuration property,
including `getValue`, `getValues`, `getConfigValue`, `getValues`, `getOptionalValue`, `getOptionalValues`
and `getConfigProperties`. The methods `getValue` and `getProperties` in `ConfigSource`, may support property
expressions as well, but it is not required by the specification.

Property expressions must also be applied to configuration properties injected via CDI. A default value
defined via `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty#defaultValue` is not eligible to be expanded since
multiple candidates may be available.

If a configuration property value or default value requires the raw value without expansion, the expression may be
escaped with a backslash ("\", double "\\" for property file based sources). For instance:

[source,properties]
----
server.url=\\${server.host}
server.host=localhost
----

The value of `server.url` is `${server.host}`.

=== Backwards Compatibility

MicroProfile Config implementations MUST provide a way to disable variable evaluation to provide backwards
compatibility. The property `mp.config.property.expressions.enabled` was introduced for this purpose. The value of the
property determines whether the property expression is enabled or disabled. The value `false` means the property
expression is disabled, while `true` means enabled.

If property expression expansion is not desirable for a specific case, the raw value on a configuration property may be
retrieved by calling `getRawValue()` in `ConfigValue`.

Specific sources may already use a similar or identical syntax to the one described in this specification. To preserve
this usage, `ConfigSource#getValue()` should perform the expression substitution and then return the resolved value.
Should such a source return a value with an expression from `ConfigSource#getValue()`, usual expression substitution
does occur as described by this spec.
