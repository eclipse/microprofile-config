/**
 * <p>
 * This is an abstraction to resolve {@link Config} values using a fluent API that is used
 * when the basic {@link Config#getValue(String, Class)} does not suffice
 * or the user wants to make sure a value is returned without an exception and excluding empty {@link String} values.
 * The method names are chosen for good readability when used as a fluent API.
 *
 * <p>
 * This API is designed so reliably result in a return value. This means by default it will not throw exceptions for
 * missing properties or failed conversion but instead return a default value that callers have to provide.
 * Alternatively to providing a default value a value can be resolved as {@link Optional}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Arrays of values can be resolved as {@link List} or {@link Set}.
 * By default these return empty lists or sets in case of missing property or failed conversion.
 *
 * <p>
 * Simple value properties defined as empty string by default are considered missing. This can be changed
 * using {@link #acceptEmpty()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Should exceptions be thrown for either missing properties or failed conversion the default of not throwing exception
 * and using default values can be overridden using {@link #throwOnMissingProperty()} and
 * {@link #throwOnFailedConversion()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Usually conversion relies on registered {@link org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.Converter}s.
 * Ad-hoc conversion can be done using {@link #asConvertedBy(Converter, Object)}.
 * Values resolved as {@link String} are not converted.
 * Values resolved as {@code String[]} are only split but elements are not converted.
 *
 * <p>
 * Typed defaults are provided with one of the {@code as}-methods.
 * Raw property string defaults can be provided using {@link #withDefault(String)}.
 * As the API can not capture if such a raw default has been provided it still requires to provide a typed default
 * or use {@link Optional} to ensure resolution will return a value.
 * If a raw {@link String} is provided it takes precedence over a typed default.
 * Should conversion of a raw default fail the typed default is used
 * or in case of {@link Optional} the property is considered not present.
 *
 * <p>
 * The only way {@code as}-methods might return a {@code null} reference is by using {@code null} as typed default.
 * In such case it is considered the intention of the caller and therefore not problematic.
